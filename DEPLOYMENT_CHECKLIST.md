2. Click "Login" (top right)
3. Enter your credentials

---

### **STEP 2: Access File Manager** ⏰ 1 minute

1. In your hosting dashboard, find "File Manager" button
2. Click "File Manager"

---

### **STEP 3: Clean Existing Files** ⏰ 2 minutes

1. In `public_html`, select all existing files (Ctrl+A)
2. Click "Delete" button
3. **KEEP** `.htaccess` if there's one already (you can delete it if unsure, we'll upload a new one)
4. Confirm deletion

---

### **STEP 4: Upload Your Files** ⏰ 5 minutes

**IMPORTANT:** Upload the CONTENTS of the dist folder, NOT the dist folder itself!

#### Method A: File Manager Upload

1. Click "Upload" button in File Manager
2. Navigate to your computer's: `C:\ganesh\code\explore_nomad_landingpage\SCOUT\dist`
3. Select **ALL files and folders** inside dist:
   - index.html
   - .htaccess
   - assets folder
   - All image files (.jpg, .png, .svg)
   - robots.txt
4. Click "Open" / "Upload"
5. Wait for upload to complete (progress bar will show)
6. Verify all files are in `public_html` (not in a subfolder!)

#### Method B: Drag & Drop (if available)

1. Open File Explorer: `C:\ganesh\code\explore_nomad_landingpage\SCOUT\dist`
2. Select ALL files inside dist
3. Drag them into the File Manager window
4. Drop into `public_html`

---

### **STEP 5: Verify File Structure** ⏰ 1 minute

Your `public_html` should look like this:

```
public_html/
  ├── .htaccess
  ├── index.html
  ├── robots.txt
  ├── assets/
  │   ├── index-BQpzXDka.js
  │   └── index-xvcFLnJ7.css
  ├── center.JPG
  ├── center1.JPG
  ├── center2.JPG
  ├── co-living.jpg
  ├── community.jpg
  ├── explore-nomad-img.png
  ├── flights.jpg
  ├── insurance.jpg
  ├── main.jpg
  ├── nomad-news.jpg
  ├── nomad-stories.jpg
  ├── sim.jpg
  ├── visa.jpg
  └── ... (other images)
```

**✅ Make sure:**
- `index.html` is directly in `public_html` (NOT in dist/public_html)
- `.htaccess` file is present
- `assets` folder is present

---

### **STEP 6: Test Your Website** ⏰ 5 minutes

1. Open your domain in a browser: `https://yourdomain.com`

2. **Test Navigation:**
   - ✅ Home page loads with animation
   - ✅ Click "Join waitlist" → Form page loads
   - ✅ Click "Values of waitlist" → Values page loads  
   - ✅ Click "Explore Nomad" → Explore page loads
   - ✅ Click "SCOUT" logo → Returns to home

3. **Test Form Submission:**
   - ✅ Go to `/join-waitlist`
   - ✅ Fill in name and email
   - ✅ Click "Join Wait-list"
   - ✅ See success message
   - ✅ Check if data saved in Supabase

4. **Test Progress Bars:**
   - ✅ Visit `/values-of-waitlist`
   - ✅ See progress bar with count (should show 207 + your signups)
   - ✅ Visit `/explore-nomad`
   - ✅ Verify progress bar shows same count

5. **Test Direct URLs (Important!):**
   - ✅ Type `yourdomain.com/join-waitlist` directly in browser
   - ✅ Should load, not show 404 error
   - ✅ Try `yourdomain.com/explore-nomad`
   - ✅ Should load, not show 404 error

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Blank/White Page
**Solution:**
- Press F12 to open browser console
- Check for errors
- Usually means files uploaded to wrong folder
- Ensure `index.html` is in `public_html` root

### Problem: 404 Error on Page Refresh
**Solution:**
- `.htaccess` file is missing or incorrect
- Re-upload `.htaccess` from dist folder
- Ensure Hostinger has mod_rewrite enabled (usually default)

### Problem: Form Doesn't Submit / Shows Error
**Solution:**
- Check browser console (F12)
- Supabase credentials may not be included in build
- Already fixed! (We rebuilt with `.env.production`)

### Problem: Images Not Loading
**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- Check if all image files uploaded
- Check file names match (case-sensitive!)

### Problem: CSS Not Applied
**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl + F5)
- Check if `assets` folder uploaded correctly
- Verify `assets/index-xvcFLnJ7.css` exists in public_html
