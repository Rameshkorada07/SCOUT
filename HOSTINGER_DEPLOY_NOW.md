## 📋 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### **STEP 1: Login to Hostinger** ⏰ 1 min

2. Click **"Login"** (top right)
3. Enter your credentials
4. Click on **"Hosting"** in the menu
5. Select your hosting plan

---

### **STEP 2: Access File Manager** ⏰ 1 min

1. In your hosting dashboard, find **"File Manager"** button
2. Click **"File Manager"**
3. Navigate to **`public_html`** folder (your website root)

---

### **STEP 3: Clean Existing Files** ⏰ 2 min

1. In `public_html`, select **ALL existing files** (Ctrl+A)
2. Click **"Delete"** button
3. Confirm deletion
4. Make sure `public_html` is empty

---

### **STEP 4: Upload Your Files** ⏰ 5-10 min

**IMPORTANT:** Upload the CONTENTS of dist folder, NOT the dist folder itself!

#### How to Upload:

1. Click **"Upload"** button in File Manager

2. Navigate to your computer's folder:
   ```
   C:\ganesh\code\explore_nomad_landingpage\SCOUT\dist
   ```

3. Select **ALL files and folders** inside dist:
   - ✅ index.html
   - ✅ .htaccess (hidden file - important!)
   - ✅ assets folder
   - ✅ All image files (.jpg, .png, .svg)
   - ✅ robots.txt

4. Click **"Open"** / **"Upload"**

5. **Wait for upload to complete** (progress bar will show)

6. **Verify** all files are in `public_html` (not in a subfolder!)

---

### **STEP 5: Verify .htaccess File** ⏰ 1 min

This is CRITICAL for React Router to work!

1. In File Manager, check if you see **`.htaccess`** file
2. If you DON'T see it:
   - Click **"Settings"** or **"Options"** in File Manager
   - Enable **"Show hidden files"**
   - Look for `.htaccess` again

3. If it's still missing:
   - Click **"New File"**
   - Name it: `.htaccess`
   - Right-click → **"Edit"**
   - Paste this content:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

   - Click **"Save"**

---

### **STEP 6: Verify File Structure** ⏰ 1 min

Your `public_html` should look like this:

```
public_html/
  ├── .htaccess              ← Must be here!
  ├── index.html
  ├── robots.txt
  ├── assets/
  │   ├── index-BN5DwRUf.js
  │   └── index-bZuyF0Hd.css
  ├── center.JPG
  ├── community.jpg
  ├── explore-nomad-img.png
  └── ... (all other images)
```

**✅ Checklist:**
- [ ] `index.html` is directly in `public_html`
- [ ] `.htaccess` file exists in `public_html`
- [ ] `assets` folder exists
- [ ] All images uploaded

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Blank/White Page
**Solution:**
- Press F12 to open browser console
- Look for errors
- Usually means files uploaded to wrong folder
- Ensure `index.html` is in `public_html` root, not in a subfolder

### Problem: 404 Error on Page Refresh or Direct URL
**Solution:**
- `.htaccess` file is missing or in wrong location
- Upload `.htaccess` to `public_html` root
- Enable "Show hidden files" in File Manager to see it

### Problem: Admin Login Doesn't Work
**Solution:**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify Supabase credentials are correct
- Make sure admin user exists in Supabase
- Try clearing browser cache

### Problem: No Users Showing in Dashboard
**Solution:**
- We already fixed the RLS policies
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check if any users exist in database
- Try refreshing the page

### Problem: Images Not Loading
**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- Check if all image files uploaded
- Verify file names match (case-sensitive)

### Problem: CSS Not Applied
**Solution:**
- Hard refresh: Ctrl + F5
- Check if `assets` folder uploaded correctly
